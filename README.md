# sysml-reactflow

SysML-ready building blocks for [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev). The package ships with OMG-friendly node chrome, relationship edges, and factories that convert SysML specifications into consumable React Flow graphs.

## Features

- üß± Prebuilt node renderers for requirements, block/internals, activities, and parametric constraints with stereotype + compartment styling.
- üîó Custom relationship edges that express `satisfy`, `verify`, `allocate`, `refine`, and generic dependencies.
- üõ†Ô∏è Data factories that transform SysML specifications into strongly typed React Flow nodes/edges.
- üó∫Ô∏è `SysMLDiagram` wrapper that wires recommended controls, minimap, and background for quick prototyping.

### Diagram coverage

- **BDD & IBD:** Block/part/value/port compartments plus allocation edges.
- **Definition vs Usage:** SysML v2 part/action/port/item definitions wired to usages via specialization & definition edges.
- **Use case:** Elliptical nodes with include/extend links and actor tagging.
- **State machines:** State + state-machine nodes, transition edges with triggers/guards/effects.
- **Sequence:** Lifeline nodes with synchronous/asynchronous/return message edges.
- **Activity:** Action nodes, fork/join bars, decision/merge diamonds, and control-flow edges.

### SysML v2 viewpoints

SysML v2 diagrams are view specifications. The library now ships with reusable viewpoints (e.g., `structuralDefinitionViewpoint`, `usageStructureViewpoint`) that materialize the appropriate nodes/edges for you:

```tsx
import {
  SysMLDiagram,
  structuralDefinitionViewpoint,
  type SysMLModel
} from 'sysml-reactflow';

const model: SysMLModel = { nodes: specs, relationships };

<SysMLDiagram model={model} viewpoint={structuralDefinitionViewpoint} />;
```

Behind the scenes the viewpoint filters the SysML element kinds, applies the correct definition/usage semantics, and renders the React Flow scene so you get a true SysML v2 environment.

## Installation

```bash
npm install sysml-reactflow react react-dom reactflow
```

## Quick start

```tsx
import { ReactFlowProvider } from 'reactflow';
import {
  SysMLDiagram,
  createNodesFromSpecs,
  createEdgesFromRelationships
} from 'sysml-reactflow';

const nodes = createNodesFromSpecs([
  {
    kind: 'requirement',
    spec: {
      id: 'REQ-101',
      name: 'Thermal Compliance',
      text: 'The payload shall remain between 0¬∞C and 40¬∞C.',
      verification: 'analysis',
      risk: 'medium',
      status: 'reviewed'
    }
  },
  {
    kind: 'block-definition',
    spec: {
      id: 'BLK-42',
      name: 'ThermalController',
      stereotype: 'block',
      description: 'Regulates loop temp.',
      parts: [{ name: 'pump', type: 'Pump', multiplicity: '2' }],
      ports: [
        { name: 'coolantIn', type: 'Coolant', direction: 'in' },
        { name: 'coolantOut', type: 'Coolant', direction: 'out' }
      ]
    }
  }
]);

const edges = createEdgesFromRelationships([
  { id: 'edge-1', type: 'satisfy', source: 'BLK-42', target: 'REQ-101', label: 'satisfy' }
]);

export function Example() {
  return (
    <ReactFlowProvider>
      <div style={{ width: '100%', height: 520 }}>
        <SysMLDiagram nodes={nodes} edges={edges} />
      </div>
    </ReactFlowProvider>
  );
}
```

## API surface

### Components

- `SysMLDiagram`: Thin wrapper over `ReactFlow` that registers the SysML node/edge types and exposes toggles for background, minimap, and controls.
- `sysmlNodeTypes`, `sysmlEdgeTypes`: Registries that can be passed directly into your own `ReactFlow` instance if you prefer manual wiring.

### Factories

- `createRequirementNode`, `createBlockNode`, `createActivityNode`, `createParametricNode`
- `createNodesFromSpecs` ‚Äì batch helper that also auto-positions nodes in a grid when explicit coordinates are not provided.
- `createRelationshipEdge`, `createEdgesFromRelationships`

All helpers are fully typed so IDEs expose the required SysML contract (id/name/info, compartments, ports, etc.). Add your own stereotypes, compartments, or tags by extending the returned node data before handing it to React Flow.

## Example catalog

See [`examples/basic.tsx`](examples/basic.tsx) for a runnable snippet that assembles a small SysML allocation chain. Drop it into a Vite/Next playground to see the styling in action.

## Storybook

Spin up the component workbench to explore SysML nodes interactively:

```bash
npm run storybook   # dev server on http://localhost:6006
npm run build-storybook   # static export in storybook-static/
```

### Continuous Storybook build

Every push or pull request triggers `.github/workflows/storybook.yml`, which installs dependencies, runs `npm run lint`, builds the static Storybook bundle, and publishes it as a GitHub Actions artifact named `storybook-static`. Grab the latest artifact from the Actions tab if you want to preview the CI build without running it locally.

### GitHub Pages deployment

The `Deploy Storybook to GitHub Pages` workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) publishes the latest Storybook build to GitHub Pages on each push to `master/main`. Visit https://hollando78.github.io/SysML-reactflow/ for the hosted docs.

## Building the package

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs `tsup` to emit both ESM (`dist/index.js`) and CJS (`dist/index.cjs`) bundles alongside type declarations.

## Roadmap ideas

- Expand node palette to include state machines, sequence diagrams, and allocation tables.
- Theme tokens + CSS variables for easier design integration.
- Optional layout helpers powered by `elkjs` or `dagre`.
